# PONG!
### For this project, we will create a game called Pong in assembly language using x8086 MASM Assembler
# Group 1: Team Pong!
* Hoang Nguyen (@Daoranger): Lead programmer, work on core mechanics of the game, github page.
* Joao Lucas: Work on user interface, presentation slides
* Balkrandeep: Work on singleplayer/AI

# How to Run the Game: 
* Create a directory (name it pong or whatever you want) in your computer, this is where your pong.asm source code and the 8086 MASM assembler are going to be in.
* Install x8086 MASM assembler and extract them into the pong directory (the pong folder above)
* Create the source code file called it pong.asm (the pong.asm file above)
* Because we already provided you the pong.asm source code file just extract it in the pong folder (we also included it in the folder for your already)
* Run DOSBox and use the command to cd into the Pong directory (mount c c:\user\path\path\pong
* Once you in the pong directory type the following command in order into DOSBox 
1. masm /a pong.asm
2. ;
3. link pong
4. ;
5. pong
* The emulator will pop up the game window
* The game is now running and you can now play it.
* Have fun!
